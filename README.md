This project involves a comprehensive workflow for preprocessing, analyzing, and modeling flight fare data using various machine learning algorithms. The steps can be summarized as follows:

1. **Data Import and Initial Inspection:**
   - The flight fare data is imported from an Excel file using `pandas`.
   - The initial structure of the data is inspected using `data.head()` and `data.info()` to understand its composition and identify any missing values.

2. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Missing values in the dataset are identified using `data.isnull().sum()`.
   - A row with a missing 'Route' value is dropped.
   - Columns 'Route' and 'Additional_Info' are dropped due to their irrelevance.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Date features are extracted from 'Date_of_Journey', and separate columns for day and month are created.
   - Departure and arrival times are split into hours and minutes.
   - The 'Duration' feature is transformed to ensure a consistent format and then split into hours and minutes.
   - 'Total_Stops' is encoded numerically.

4. **Label Encoding:**
   - Categorical variables 'Airline', 'Source', and 'Destination' are encoded using `LabelEncoder`.

5. **Data Preparation:**
   - The dataset is split into features (X) and target variable (y).
   - Train-test split is performed with an 80-20 ratio.

6. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - A Linear Regression model is trained and evaluated.
   - Additional models including Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor are trained and evaluated.
   - Model performances are compared using cross-validation scores.

7. **Model Selection and Saving:**
   - Random Forest Regressor is selected as the final model based on performance.
   - The model is saved using `joblib` for future use.

**Key Results:**
- The Linear Regression model achieved reasonable scores but was outperformed by the ensemble methods.
- The Random Forest Regressor demonstrated the best performance with high training and testing scores.
- The model is saved for future predictions and can be reloaded as needed.

This workflow ensures a systematic approach to handling and modeling flight fare data, providing a robust pipeline for future data analysis and prediction tasks.
